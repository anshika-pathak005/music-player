# 🎵 Music Player

A responsive music player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring dynamic playlists, real-time progress tracking, and smooth playback controls.

(live demo link - coming soon) 

## 🔍 Overview

I built this project to learn how to manage audio playback with JavaScript and design an interactive, modern interface.

While I used a tutorial for structural guidance, all code was written independently, with additional features implemented by me, including:

- Responsive layout for all screen sizes  
- Curated playlist of favorite songs  
- UI refinements and custom controls  

## ✨ Features

- ▶️ Play/Pause toggle with animated control icon  
- ⏭ Next / Previous controls with automatic looping  
- 📊 Dynamic progress bar — updates in real-time and supports seeking  
- 📂 Slide-in playlist panel — click to play any song instantly  
- 🎵 Displays song name, artist, and cover image dynamically  
- 📱 Responsive design — works smoothly on mobile and desktop  
- 🎚 Custom-styled range slider for better interaction  
- 🔄 Automatic reset — progress and button state reset when a song ends  

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🚀 Installation / Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Place your music files in the `media/` folder and update the playlist in JS if needed.  
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.  
4. Use the controls or open the playlist panel to select songs.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Controlling HTML `<audio>` elements with JavaScript  
- Syncing the UI with audio events (`onloadedmetadata`, `ontimeupdate`, `onended`)  
- Using `clamp()`, `flex`, and `minmax` for responsive layouts  
- Building interactive playlists dynamically with JavaScript
